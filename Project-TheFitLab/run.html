    <p2><b><pre> How to Eat Before, During, and After a Run     </b></p2>
             <p5>Read time • 7 Min</p5>
                 

 <p1>  In addition to selecting the right shoes and putting together a training plan, deciding what to eat ranks high for making the most of your running. Eat too little or inappropriate types of foods 
    and you may find yourself dragging way too soon. Eat too much and you could deal with bloating and discomfort.
 </p1>
 <p1>  That’s why it’s helpful to understand the best way to fuel up before, during, and after a run. We asked experts to share insights on top questions that can help optimize your eating for more 
    energy and better performance.</p1>

    <b>What Should I Eat Before a Run, and How Much?</b>
<p1>    The answer depends on the kind of run you have planned, according to Kacie Vavrek, RD, a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics and an outpatient dietitian at The Ohio State University 
     Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. If you’re planning on a run that lasts for an hour or longer, it’s helpful to have a pre-workout snack that you tolerate well. That choice is highly individual, 
     she adds, and it takes some experimentation to figure out what works for you.
    
    Too much protein, like a whole chicken breast or more, usually isn’t advisable since it requires longer to digest when combined with carbs, per research. This means energy isn’t as readily 
    available to your body as the energy you get from quick-digesting carbs.
    
    </p1>
    
    <b>Do I Need to Fuel Up During a Run? If So, When and With What Foods?</b>
<p1>     Much like eating before you run, this depends on how long you’re running. If it’s under an hour, you’re unlikely to need a boost, Ray says. But on longer runs, carbs and electrolytes 
    are recommended for every hour of the run.

    Not surprisingly, the most popular during-run options tend to be the easiest to carry while you’re running and should give you about 30 to 60 grams of quickly digestible carbs, says Vavrek. 
    These include sports gels or gummy snacks, which can increase the amount of glycogen in your muscles.  </p1>
<p1>       In general, a snack that has a blend of lean protein and carbohydrates tends to be best, adds Hopkinsville, Kentucky–based dietitian Elizabeth Ray, RDN. For example, a small amount of 
    skinless grilled chicken paired with a serving of sweet potatoes. Other options include:

    <b>~Banana or apple with nut butter</b>
    <b>~Toast with half an avocado and a tablespoon
    of honey</b>
    <b>~Small bowl of oatmeal and berries</b>
    <b>~Bagel with nut butter</b>
</p1>
    <b>What About After a Run?</b>
<p1>     As with any workout, eating after a run helps recovery. But Ray says there’s still debate about when it’s best to eat once you’re finished. Some runners do well having a protein-packed 
    meal within an hour after an intense run, while others do better with a snack similar to pre-run choices, like a banana and nut butter.

    “Even if you have gels or other carb sources during a run, your glycogen will still be depleted when you finish,” adds Vavrek. “Because of that, incorporate some carbs. But you can also 
    bring in more protein at this point (about 20 to 30 grams), along with more fluids and electrolytes.”  </p1>

    <b>What About Hydration?</b> 
    
    <p1>There’s no debate here: Hydration is incredibly important. Ray says that having a handheld water bottle or hydration pack can be just as essential as running shoes. That will allow you 
        to sip water throughout your run — no matter how long it is — to replace what you’re losing through sweat. 
        Because that sweat contains minerals — mainly sodium and chloride, per the American Council on Exercise — you need to replace those as well, and that’s where the electrolytes come into play. 
        Plenty of electrolyte powders and tablets on the market dissolve in water, but you can also make your own by adding some sea salt and coconut water to your water bottle, says Ray.

        However, not every run warrants an electrolyte beverage. Research shows that you may sweat enough during an intense workout lasting an hour or longer, making it a good time to sip 
        an electrolyte drink. But for shorter, less intense workouts, water should be sufficient.</p1>
        
<p1>     It’s more important to get what you need so your body can perform well, and that means eating right foods, 
     but it also means eating enough of them</p1>

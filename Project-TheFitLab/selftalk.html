<p2><b><pre>How to Practice Positive Self-Talk
How Your Inner Dialogue Affects Your Mental Health and Goals </b></p2>
<p5>Read time • 14 Min</p5>


<p1>How do you talk to yourself? Before you deny that you talk to yourself, take a second to recognize that an inner dialogue and talking to ourselves (intentionally and subconsciously) are normal 
and even helpful parts of life. 
</p1>
<b>What is self-talk?</b>
<p1> When identifying self-talk, think about the statements or verbalizations that one makes toward the self. These statements can be subconscious, meaning we aren’t really aware of them, or we can 
be intentional about what we say and how we say it toward ourselves (Hardy, 2006). So, if you are looking out for your own self-talk, pay attention to your inner dialogue, particularly during 
difficult times.</p1>

<b>Why self-talk can be helpful?</b>
<p1> Self-talk can serve a few purposes for our lives and for performance on a given task. Often, self-talk is used instructionally to get us through the steps of a given task or situation (Hardy, 2006). 
For example, when I am doing one of Daniel and/or Kelli’s kickboxing routines, I will often say the steps of the combination (sometimes out loud!) to keep myself on track and doing the right movements. 
This instructional motivation can either help us to learn and engage in new skills or can help us to improve our skills or strategies over time (Hardy et al., 2001). </p1>

<b>Negative self talk</b>
<p1> I would argue that many people (especially a lot who come in to see me in therapy) have a tendency to engage in negative self-talk. Negative self-talk typically takes the form of criticism and often 
causes anxiety or feelings of shame or doubt. For example, I have had people indicate that when they mess up they ask themsleves “Why are you so dumb?,” say “I suck at this,” or tell themselves “I’m never 
going to get this.” As you can imagine, these are not exactly the motivating statements we need to hear when times are tough. 

A lot of people truly believe that negative self-talk is what they need to get through tough times, which is completely fine if that truly works for them. I sometimes ask people to simply imagine what could 
be different in their life if they used positive self-talk (either in addition to or in replacement of the negative). Often, it would make them happier, decrease negative emotions, or be motivating. </p1>

<b>Self-talk as related to sport/exercise and food behaviors</b>
<p1> The way we talk to ourselves plays an important role in our health-behaviors. For example, it can impact how, when, and why we engage in a particular exercise behavior or can contribute to the types and quantity 
of food we choose to eat. Not to mention that the running internal dialogue is often a contributor to feelings of depression or anxiety prevalent in so many mental health disorders. 

Research shows that within sports and exercise, self-talk is particularly helpful for fine motor skills that help us with precision in our movements (Hatzigeorgiadis et al., 2011). When we are trying to do things 
that require small or precise movements, self-talk can help us to more effectively perform those tasks. So, when you are doing things that require precision, dexterity, or coordination, try out some self-talk and 
see how it helps! </p1> 

<p1>Based on this research and my general psychology training, I have come up with a list of tips that might help you out on your self-talk journey. As always, there is no one right or wrong way 
to engage in self-talk, so try out many things and see what works best for you!
<b>~Monitor self-talk :</b>The best first step in being intentional about self-talk is just noticing it when it happens. You likely have a running internal dialogue that you may or
may not be aware of at any given time. If you aren’t aware of how you typically talk to yourself, stop and notice where your mind goes next time you’re in a difficult or stressful position.
Notice that little voice in the back of your head: the tone, the content, and the impact this voice has on you. At the same time, we are sometimes able to observe the self-talk that other 
people engage in throughout their days. When someone we know does something difficult, they may say that self-talk out loud. While I don’t encourage you to try to change their self-talk 
(after all, we can’t change other people), it is helpful to be aware of how others close to us talk to themselves. This can help us make a mental note of how we do/don’t want to talk to ourselves.

<b>~First v. third person :</b>This one sounds interesting because most people don’t go about their days talking in third person (saying “you can do it” or “Haley wants an apple” to ourselves). 
However, research shows that talking in third person creates some psychological distance from the self-talk and allows us to more effectively regulate our emotions in a given situation. Talking 
to ourselves in first person, on the other hand, keeps us closer to our emotions and engaging with the emotions (Kross et al., 2014). So, it can be helpful to be intentional about whether you 
talk to yourself in first or third person based on the situation at hand. If you need to keep perspective, think abstractly, and regulate intense emotions, then third person is for you. If you 
have been avoiding your emotions and need to engage with or increase awareness of them, then first person is for you.

<b>~Increase self-talk for novel tasks: </b>Research shows that self-talk is particularly helpful for and has stronger effects on us when we are learning a new skill. Self-talk in these situations 
tends to have immediate and lasting effects on our ability to take on that skill (Hatzigeorgiadis et al., 2011). Therefore, when you are doing or trying something new (such as a new training style!), 
be intentional about engaging in both instructional and motivational self-talk to help you get through it and keep going.

<b>~External reminders: </b> though the large majority of self-talk is subconsciously generated and automatic, that doesn’t mean we can’t be intentional about changing or adding in self-talk that suits us. 
If you are working toward incorporating certain aspects of self-talk into your life, feel free to set external reminders so that you don’t forget. For example, use sticky notes, phone reminders, or trusted 
friends to remind you of how you want to talk to yourself. These external reminders can serve as a source of inspiration and help you to reroute when you are feeling down or talking negatively toward yourself. 

</p1>
<p1> As odd as it sounds, I encourage you to talk to yourself — and often! Just be sure that what you say to yourself and how you say it makes a difference to help you work toward goals or protect your mental health. 
I would love to hear from you about times when self-talk has been particularly helpful or ways you have changed your self-talk to work in your favor. Let us know in the comments below!</p1>

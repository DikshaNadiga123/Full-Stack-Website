 <B>What is procrastination?</B>
 <p1>Procrastination is the act of putting off important activities or tasks even when we know that the consequences of this delay are substantial (Klingsieck, 2013). Procrastination can be 
    either behavioral or decisional in nature. Behavioral procrastination is the delay of tasks, whereas decisional procrastination is the delay of making decisions (Karas & Spada, 2009). 
    Additionally, procrastination can either be a trait in which someone procrastinates on all or most tasks or it can be task/situation-specific. 
    
    This definition has a few components that distinguish it from what scholars call strategic delay or the intentional delay of activities or tasks in order to obtain some known benefit 
    (more information, greater preparedness, etc.). Procrastination involves an unnecessary delay of the activity and this delay leads to significant discomfort or negative consequences for 
    the individual (Klingsieck, 2013). These consequences can range from mild stress to failure to complete important tasks (which may snowball into further consequences).
    Procrastination has significant negative implications for many domains of our lives. Generally, it is linked with poorer well-being and academic/work performance (Klingsieck, 2013). Within
    the realm of health and wellness, procrastination affects our health both directly through added stress and indirectly through the delay of health-promoting behaviors (Kelly & Walton, 
    2021). When we unnecessarily put off certain health-related tasks — like exercise — this can lead to an overall less active life, which is related to all sorts of other health concerns. </p1>
    
 <b>Procrastination of health-promoting behaviors</b>
 <p1>The majority of research on procrastination has been conducted within the context of academic and/or work life. However, there is burgeoning research on the procrastination of 
    health-promoting behaviors that also has important implications for our general well-being.
    Procrastination tends to impact at a greater rate tasks that people deem undesirable, making exercise a common task that some people put off as long as possible. In fact, one 
    study found that people who are generally high in trait procrastination — meaning they tend to procrastinate all things in their life — are more likely to also procrastinate with exercise.
    This procrastination then led to overall less physical activity (Kelly & Walton, 2021). Low levels of physical activity has been identified as a predictor of future exercise 
    procrastination. Essentially, when people have low physical activity, they tend to develop low self-efficacy for exercise and negative attitude about that exercise, which leads to even 
    more procrastination (Zhai et al., 2021). This contributes to some people not moving their bodies in ways that enable them to live their best lives.
    Another health-promoting behavior that often gets put off is sleep. Some people have a tendency to delay their bedtime unintentionally and/or unskillfully, despite knowing that not 
    sleeping will have negative outcomes for their life in the days to come. Sleep procrastination is related to poorer sleep outcomes like quality and quantity of sleep. Poor sleep is known to 
    be related to health issues (hypertension, diabetes, and depression to name just a few), work/school problems, and generally poorer well-being (Valshtein et al., 2020). </p1>
    
<b> Contributing factors to procrastination</b>
 <p1>Given all of this information, what factors contribute to procrastination? This isn’t an easy question to answer, as the reason for any two people can be vastly different — not to mention the
    fact that even for a single person there can be several reasons. However, research shows that there are several factors that contribute to greater levels of procrastination. Seven of those 
    contributing factors are listed below.
    <b>~ Low self-efficacy:</b> Self-efficacy refers to a specific person’s belief in their own ability to succeed at a given task or domain (Bandura, 1977). When we have low self-efficacy, we 
    are less likely to be motivated, keep going when things get tough, or set goals for that task. It is no wonder, then, that procrastination is more common amongst folks with lower levels of 
    self-efficacy (Klingsieck, 2013). When we don’t feel like we can do something but still hold that task as a priority, we will keep it in our minds, but continue putting it off. 
    
    <b>~ Difficulty of task:</b>  people procrastinate because the task is just too difficult for their current skill level. The idea of completing the task becomes overwhelming and
     creates such high fear or dread that we employ a common coping technique: avoidance. This avoidance turns into long-term procrastination and may or may not ever be completed.
     
    <b>~ Self-protection: </b>Procrastination can also be an intentional self-handicapping coping strategy that protects our self-esteem if we are to fail a given task. If we feel or believe
     we are unable to successfully perform a given task, procrastination gives us a valid reason to have failed. Rather than attributing that failure to an inability or incompetence, we can say 
     that we had a million other things to do and couldn’t devote our full time. This allows us to emerge from the perceived failure with our self-esteem roughly in tact.
     
    <b>~ Mental health:</b> There are several mental health concerns that have been known to be related to greater levels of procrastination, including ADHD, depression, and anxiety 
    (Klingsieck, 2013). The inattentive symptoms of ADHD, in particular, seems to disrupt people’s capacity to carry out the necessary functions to regularly plan and complete tasks (Niermann & 
    Scheres, 2014). Depression and anxiety are not direct causes of procrastination, but certainly exacerbate the problem. It seems like this is particularly true when people engage in more
     rumination, or deep and repetitive thoughts about negative things in their life (Constantin et al., 2018).
     
    <b>~ Perfectionism: </b>Though it seems counterintuitive, those high in perfectionism tend to exhibit greater levels of procrastination. In particular, those with what has been deemed
     maladaptive perfectionism — holding oneself to a high standard and perceiving the self as unable to achieve that standard (hello again, self-efficacy) — are more likely to feel the 
     negative effects of procrastination (Coutinho et al., 2022). It is my experience that folks who are highly perfectionistic fear failure, and this fear can be almost paralyzing for them, 
     making it hard to get started. 
     
    <b>~ Motivational failure: </b>Procrastination is viewed by some as a failure to appropriately motivate oneself to do a given task. There is evidence that those who are highly intrinsically
     motivated — meaning they find personal reward from the task — are less likely to engage in procrastination (Klingsieck, 2013). When we lack this intrinsic motivation, we have to find other 
     ways to get ourselves to complete an important task (like an external reward, praise, or attention). Our mindset and attitude toward the task(s) can hinder us from ever getting to it, 
     contributing to greater levels of procrastination. 
     
    <b>~ Reinforcement from past experiences:</b> There are occasions when we procrastinate and everything turns out okay anyway. We go through all the worrying and stress and then it all works
     out. Unfortunately, this positive experience with procrastination can turn into a reinforcer that makes it more likely that we will procrastinate again in the future. We think to ourselves,
      “Well, it was okay last time,” and that reduces our anxiety. The more this works out in our favor, the more likely we are to continue engaging in procrastination. 
    So, now that we know where procrastination comes from, what do we do to manage its effects? </p1>
    
 <b>Tips for managing procrastination</b>
 <p1>While there is not necessarily a single way to overcome procrastination, there are several things that people can do in conjunction to overcome procrastination. Below are a few tips.
    <b>~ Mindset evaluation: </b>Sometimes, people inadequately label their selective delaying as procrastination and feel significant anxiety about it anyway. So, if you notice that you are 
    procrastinating, take a moment to assess whether there is a legitimate reason for the procrastination. For example, I once had a major project for work that required me to meet with several 
    people in order to adequately complete the project; starting the project before those meetings might've meant needing to make significant changes later on. Delaying beginning the project was 
    giving me severe anxiety, but this is an example of strategic delay, not procrastination. In cases like this, you must first shift your mindset toward recognizing the situation for what it is: 
    you are doing this to reap overall benefits in the long-run. However, this doesn’t get rid of the anxiety and the overarching goal shifts from reducing procrastination toward coping with anxiety. 
     
    <b>~ Self-compassion:</b> There is evidence that the tendency to procrastinate is decreased amongst those who are high in self-compassion. The ability to approach life situations with a 
    non-self-judgmental attitude and exhibit kindness toward the self — regardless of our perceived ability level — means that we are less likely to put things off for the aforementioned reasons 
    (Rapoport et al., 2022). Self-compassion is a skill that needs to be actively practiced to see continued benefits, so be sure to engage in active strategies that help you flex this muscle.
    
    <b>~ Shaping:</b> When a given task feels too large, too difficult, or generally overwhelming, we can use the behaviorist principle of shaping to help us manage the inevitable anxiety. Shaping 
    is when we break down a large or complex task into successive approximations or “baby steps” toward the desired behavior and reward ourselves for things that help us out or get us a bit closer to 
    our goal behavior. For example, I once worked with a person who was perceived by others in their life as having personal hygiene issues. In reality, their depression was making it hard for them to
     be able to do anything, and they were seriously procrastinating doing laundry and therefore wearing dirty clothing. So, the goal became to do laundry at least once every other week. This person 
     would reward themself for any attempt at laundry (putting clothing in the hamper, sorting the clothing by colors, stripping their bed, actually taking the laundry to the laundry room). These rewards 
     eventually enabled them to complete a single load, which deserved a huge reward and got them enough momentum to keep going! This eventually led to more regular laundry completion, which helped to 
     manage their overall hygiene.
     
    <b>~ Process goal focus:</b> Generally, having goals is an important step toward reducing procrastination. The act of setting a goal makes it more likely that we will go through with the target 
    behavior. That being said, the type of goal that one sets matters. Focusing on process goals rather than outcome goals tends to reduce procrastination more effectively. Process goals are those we 
    set that focus primarily on the means toward an end, whereas outcome goals focus on the end itself. For example, if your overarching goal is related to gaining strength and muscle, a process goal might
     be to “get in 2-3 strength sessions per week,” whereas an outcome goal might be “to be able to lift X-number of pounds.” That being said, having a process goal does not mean that you don’t also have 
     some end-goal in mind — that just isn’t the primary focus. One study found that amongst folks in an 8-week HIIT workout program, those with a process focus were less likely to procrastinate and actually 
     worked out more consistently and more overall than those with an outcome focus. Those with the process focus perceived the workout as less difficult and were more satisfied with each individual workout 
     (Kaftan & Freund, 2019). Therefore, be sure to incorporate process goals into your overall goal-setting!
    
    <b>~ Intentional deadlines:</b> Most people who procrastinate are able to get their work done in the last few hours or days before a given deadline. That being said, it is sometimes helpful for folks to 
    intentionally set their own deadlines at a time where you “should” get the task done, rather than at a time where you “must” get the task done. While this requires self-discipline, this can help you 
    increase pressure to complete a task by a particular time without so much pressure that it feels mission critical. This can help keep the anxiety at a manageable — rather than overwhelming — level and 
    may help you to be able to actually complete the task(s). 
    
    <b>~ Mental health support:</b> As always, if you assess that your procrastination is stemming from mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, or ADHD, then maybe seeking help from a mental health
     professional is a great step for you. Be sure to mention that procrastination is something you are struggling with and would like to discuss. </p1>

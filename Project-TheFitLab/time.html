<p2><b><pre> Time management </b></p2>
<p5>Read time • 7 Min</p5>


<p1> Ah, time management. So many people feel this is THE solution to their problems: “If only I managed my time better, I could do everything I want." While for some, time management may be a 
contributing factor to fitting in all your goals and tasks, it may not be the silver bullet you are looking for. Often, it isn’t time management that gets in our way, but rather incorrectly 
prioritizing our time or having too high of expectations for how much we can do. 
</p1>
<p1> Lets explore the relative roles of time management and priorities in our lives, as well as research regarding the benefits of time management. .</p1>

<b>What exactly is time management?</b>
<p1> The name “time management” has been called out as a sort of misnomer. We can’t actually manage or change time itself, but rather how we personally manage the time we have (Claessens et al., 2005). 
People who have better time management skills do not have more time in their days than those who don’t. Therefore, time management has been defined as a decision-making model that helps people to 
be able to place structure around their use of time as well as adapt and protect said time when there are other demands on our time (Aeon et al., 2020). The three key components I want to call out 
within this definition are: 

<b>~Time management structure</b>
<b>~Ability to adapt to changes</b>
<b>~Strategies for protecting our time</b>
</p1>
<b>Benefits of time management behaviors</b>
<p1> What does time management actually do for us? Research suggests that time management is linked with many improved outcomes, including a greater perception in our ability to control time. 
Though we can’t actually control time itself, the perception that we have greater control helps many people feel calmer and more productive (Claessens et al., 2005). Additionally, greater time 
management skills leads to better performance in both professional and academic settings (Aeon et al., 2020). Time management helps us to be able to actually get the things done that are expected 
of us in these settings and reduces the likelihood (though doesn’t eliminate the possibility) that we will procrastinate tasks for significant amounts of time. Finally, those with stronger time 
management skills have improved wellbeing and life satisfaction (Claessens et al., 2005; Aeon et al., 2020). This is largely due to the reduction in stress that we experience because of all of the 
aforementioned factors. </p1>

<b>Priorities</b> 

<p1>Despite these benefits of time management, it all means very little if we are not intentional about the priorities in our lives. We cannot manage to incorporate more things into our lives and 
days than we have capacities for. Thus, I often ask people I work with to consider what is most important in their lives and set their goals and time management strategies around those priorities. 
This process is similar to gardening, where we have to prune back certain leaves or parts of the plants in order to help the plants to flourish. With our goals and priorities in life, we sometimes 
have to cut out or cut back on some of the things that no longer serve us so that the things that are important can grow.</p1>


<b>Importance of balance</b> 

<p1>I want to refrain from contributing to the narrative that we must always be productive and get everything done on our to-do list. I want to refrain from contributing to the value judgments that are 
often placed on people who do or do not have strong time management skills. In today’s society — with value placed on efficiency and productivity — it is easy to look at people we consider highly 
efficient and say they are better than us. We all have different priorities, different needs, and different capacities. </p1>

<p1> One study found that people who get the recommended amount of exercise in their weeks tend to combine non-health related goals with exercise to overcome the perception of not having enough time. 
For example, biking to work (combining exercise and transportation) or walking while socializing with friends (exercise and leisure; Rebar et al., 2019). Therefore, you can get creative with how and where you fit physical 
activity into your life (or other prioritized tasks) in order to achieve your goals. This helps to maintain a sense of balance in our lives. </p1>
